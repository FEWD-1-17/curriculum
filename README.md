# Homework
The homework and in-class assignments for this course are designed to help you apply and hone the skills and knowledge you’re learning. Assignments build upon each other, and each represents a different element of your final project. Some assignments will be done in class, while others will be completed as homework.

Homework does not receive a grade, only confirmation of whether or not it’s been completed. To submit your homework use this link: <a href="https://form.jotform.com/230144447034144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://form.jotform.com/230144447034144</a>

Homework is due the Thursday (US) / Friday (AU) AFTER the week it was assigned.  If homework is turned in on time, it will be given a full review along with comments on the work.  Late homework will be accepted up to and including the last day of class but will only be checked for completion.


# Final Project
In your final project for FEWD, you will create a web site that uses the techniques you've learned throughout the course, including interactive components with JavaScript. You will work on your project throughout the course, starting with a project proposal and wireframe around halfway through the course. Completing and submitting your final project is a requirement for graduation. 

More information on the Final Project can be found here: This document contains all of the information you’ll need for your final project, including requirements and prompts. Bookmark it to keep it as a reference point!

You will work on your project throughout the course in your homework and in-class assignments.  You will present your project work twice: in a midpoint presentation and a final presentation. 

Your final project will be graded according to these criteria found here, and you’ll receive qualitative feedback from your classmates and instructors. Completing and submitting your final project is a requirement for graduation. Final projects should be “submitted” by providing the links to both the live github pages site and the github repo.
