#FEWD: Troubleshooting Exercise


---


###Exercise Problem 

Your client has had an intern work on a landing page and something has gone horribly wrong.  They are now in a panic 
and have asked you to try to repair the damaged page.  They have identified the followng problems:

--The images are all broken
--All the styles seem to be missing
--When the user clicks on the + icon in each entry, the entry should expand.  It doesn't do anything
--When a horse type is selected, it should filter the display so that only that type of horse is shown (draft, light, pony, etc)
--The title "Directory of Horse Breeds" should be all upper case
--The images all have the same alt text. They should have the correct text
--It seems like the toggle shows a broken image sometimes

The client is extremely distressed and needs help! Think through the troubleshooting process... what are the most likely causes of the errors?  Is one thing broken or are there many?
