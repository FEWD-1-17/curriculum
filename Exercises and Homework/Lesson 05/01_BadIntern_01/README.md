#FEWD: Bad Intern Troubleshooting #1


---


###Exercise Problem 

Your client has had an intern work on a content page and something has gone horribly wrong.  They are now in a panic and have asked you to try to repair the damaged page.  They have identified the followng problems:

- The first image is broken
- The second image seems to be stretched
- Images that are smaller than the width of the content box should center.
- The paragraphs are all slurred together. There should be 20px of space between them.
- The other articles column is appearing below the article column. It should be to the right
- There is a horrible line that is appearing next to the text starting around halfway down
- The blockquote's border should be flush with the left edge of the content box and there should be space between it and the quote's text
- The other articles column seems to have inconsistent color formatting. The middle article is blue.

The client is extremely distressed and needs help! (They are sitting in the conference room pacing and the project manager is trying to keep them calm) Think through the troubleshooting process... what are the most likely causes of the errors?  Is one thing broken or are there many?
