#FEWD: Troubleshooting Exercise


---


###Exercise Problem 

You have a new e-commerce client that has asked your company to build a product list page based off of an API. Once again, the intern was allowed to work on the project and has caused terrible mayhem. The client is very distraught!  They have identified the followng problems:

* The page bookmark is showing the wrong title. It should be "Sock Commerce"
* The hero image is missing (should be sockHero.png)
* None of the products are showing
* The product title should be rgb(60,60,60) and not the horrible color it currently is
* The product images aren't showing
* None of the product links seem to be working (title, picture, or cta)
* The price isn't showing
* The size selectors:
    * Do not show
    * Do not work
* From their tech team: The various inputs do not seem to be getting unique IDs
* The color swatches when clicked do not:
    * Switch the color of the socks
    * Show which color has been clicked
