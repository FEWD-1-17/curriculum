# Validation Lab

In this lab we will be extending out bootstrap 4 form with validation.  There are two forms on this page and you need to create a validation for each one of them.

* Your functions are already set up in the starter but need to be filled in.
* Add error messages to the 'messages' array if a validation fails.

## Validation Rules
* Passwords and Names must be at least 3 characters
* On the profile form, the two password fields must match
* There is an email address validation function included in the code. Use it to determine if the submitted email is valid.
