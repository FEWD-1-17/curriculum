# Instructions for Bootstrap Login Forms

In this exercise we will use bootstrap to build the login page for Relaxr users.  The starter code already has bootstrap's tabbed navigation present.

## Key Features
1. Must provide different forms for current and new users.
2. Current users need to supply email address and password
3. New users must supply first name, last name, email address, password, and confirm the password.

## Instructions

1. Create the form for existing users (there is a comment in the html where this should go)
2. Create the relevant inputs for username and password.  
3. Make the submit button a large, primary bootstrap button
4. Create the form for new users (there is a comment in the html where this should go)
5. Add the inputs for new users.  Be user to use the correct field types (text for text, password for passwords, etc).  
6. Make the submit button a large, primary bootstrap button


## Hints

- You may need to use bootsrap rows and columns for layout purposes.  See the Bootstrap Manual's CSS page -> Forms section.
- You shouldn't need to add much if any css. You will need to add a lot of bootstrap classes and sometimes, extra html tags to the code.


## Bonus

1. Create a new tab for "Forgotten Password"
2. Create the form for users that wish to recover their password with the field "email address"
3. Add a submit button that is an "alert" or "warning" type bootstrap button.
