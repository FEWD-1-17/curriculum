#FEWD Week #6 Project: Working with Arrays

---


###Description


The team from CitiPix has reached out for iteration on their prototype.  Instead of using a user's text input to change the background of the interface, the CitiPix user experience designers have asked to see how a drop-down menu would work in place of an input field.  The product managers are hopeful it will also lead to less error handling for their engineers and data team.  Use what you've learned this week about data-types and arrays and use the starter code - or your code from last week - and make the adjustments to your JavaScript file. Be sure to start out with Pseudocode.

| Create an array with the following values: "NYC", "SF", "LA", "ATX", "SYD"; use the array to add values to the `````` menu by using a ```for``` loop in JavaScript (don't update the HTML to do this!) |                                |                        |                          |
| When the user changes the input of the drop-down, update the background image based on what they selected                                                                                              |                                |                        |                          |

| Use the ```$.attr()``` function to update html classes                                                                                                                                                 |                                |                        |                          |
| Get the value of user input using ```$.val()```                                                                                                                                                        |                                |                        |                          |
| Use the ```$.change``` event handler to capture user actions                                                                                                                                           |                                |                        |                          |
